Use one entry per study/build day. Keep entries short, evidence-based, and interview-facing.

## 2026-09-07 — Day 1: Preprocessing + Corpus Scope

### What I built or drafted

- Preprocessing module that loads JSONL corpus rows, combines title + text, normalizes whitespace, preserves display text casing, and emits lowercase retrieval tokens.

### Course checkpoint completed

- Boot.dev RAG chapter/lesson: Preprocessing chapter completed
- Exercises completed or attempted: Completed in Boot.dev

### Corpus decision

- Corpus v0 selected: synthetic procurement KB mini-corpus
- Why this corpus: small, non-confidential, inspectable, and suitable for learning preprocessing/retrieval behavior from first principles
- Expected query types: approval thresholds, supplier onboarding, SaaS security requirements, logistics RFP scoring, contract-specific lookups, invoice mismatches

### What failed or was confusing

- Deciding whether preprocessing should preserve casing or lowercase everything.

### What became clearer

- Retrieval tokens and display/audit text can have different normalization contracts.

### What I can now explain in an interview

- Why lowercasing helps lexical matching but can damage display fidelity and acronym/entity traceability.

### What remains weak

- Tokenization decisions around punctuation, legal suffixes like Ltd./Inc., stop-word removal, and whether punctuation tokens should remain for TF-IDF.

### Next step

- Move into TF-IDF / inverted index work for HER-263 after preprocessing v0 is understandable.
